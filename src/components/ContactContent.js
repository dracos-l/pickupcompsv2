      My grandma passed away yesterday and who comes running in right after but LeMickey!! He snatches the ring right off of her cold dead fingers and runs away. Too bad he doesnâ€™t know that my grandfather proposed to her at Disney world. Just another Mickey Mouse ring for LeMickey.

On the 12th day of Christmas LeMickey gave to me

12 excuses given

11 choked quarters

10 faked finals

9 tears to the refs

8 missed free throws

7 flops and travels

6 finals losses

5 turnovers

4 fake rings

3 superteams

2 times saved

And an undeserved Mickey Mouse ring
