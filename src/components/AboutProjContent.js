        Me and LeBum were in class the other day when the teacher paired us up as partners for a book report. Everything was going fine until LeFraud asked me which book we should choose to do our report on and I suggested the Lord of the Rings. Out of nowhere LeCrybaby burst out into TEARS in front of the whole class! The teacher came over to console him and sent me to Principal Adam Silverâ€™s office as punishment. How was I supposed to know that LeMickey was scared of that book because he could never win a real ring himself?
